## Getting Started

There are no external dependencies required in order to play around with the model parameters. The Java code utilizes basic libraries found in any modern java JDK. However, in order to plot the results one  needs a plotting tool that can go along with java code.

### Prerequisites

Nothing to install. Add the Java classes to your existing project.

## Running the tests

Currently there is no testing environment.

## Contributing

Feel free to contributing. As for now, there are no specific requirements for contributing.
